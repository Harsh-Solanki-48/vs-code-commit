    <h1>Top 5 ways to stay calm and reduce stress</h1>
    <div style='font-style: italic'>By: John Halderman</div><p>
    Are you looking for more calm satisfying experience with you daily life?
    <p>
    Do you get frustrated with yourself at the end of the day because you've gotten stressed, unfocused or agitated?
    <p>
    Are you tired of getting over emotional and worn out.
    <p>
    Whether you are experiencing one or all of these feelings here are my 5 best tips on reducing the unwanted feelings so that you will feel calm and satisfied with yourself each day.
    <p>
    <strong>1. Catch yourself when you exhibit a feeling of behavior that you don't like and change it.</strong><br>
    At first you may not notice the feeling until after you have gone through it, that's fine.
    <p>
    Think about how you would rather have felt.
    <p>
    Think about how you would rather have handled yourself. Decide how you want to do it next time.
    <p>
    As you continue with this process each day you will find that you will notice more easily what you are doing throughout the day.
    <p>
    You will begin to catch yourself earlier and earlier as you do this.
    <p>
    Eventually, you will be seeing yourself while you are doing it, then stop yourself.
    <p>
    At some point you will be able to notice before you even begin to feel and react in the undesirable way.
    <p>
    Here is where you will actually begin to change the way you react to the situations in your life and change your behavior.
    <p>
    <strong>2. Stay centered all day by refocusing throughout the day.</strong><br>
    Develop the habit of paying attention to your mindset as the day goes on.
    <p>
    Several times a day, step away from what you are doing to get re-centered.
    <p>
    Sit down close your eyes and take several long slow deep breaths while imagining the tension washing slowly out of your body.
    <p>
    Notice your breathing getting slower and calmer.
    <p>
    Just think about your breath.
    <p>
    Try to keep from thinking about anything in particular.
    <p>
    It's ok to not be actively thinking for a while!
    <p>
    <strong>3. Watch out for your expectations.</strong><br>
    You are setting yourself up for failure, upset and frustration when you set too many standards as to how you think things should be.
    <p>
    Think about what leads you to getting upset?
    <p>
    Why does it upset you?
    <p>
    Notice that you decide how many things should be, based on your own outlook and desire.
    <p>
    The things others do that are not to your liking, even the things you do that don't match your expectations.
    <p>
    Ask yourself, really how important is it that they be exactly that way
    <p>
    Ask, who am I to insist that they are that way?
    <p>
    Does it matter that much?
    <p>
    Is it worth getting myself worked up about?
    <p>
    Choose which expectations are really important for you to hold on to and which ones are not.
    <p>
    Holding on to many expectations just complicates your life, with constant judgment.
    <p>
    Simplify your life and reduce the stress!
    <p>
    <strong>4. Delegate.</strong><br>
    This applies to your personal life as well as at work.
    <p>
    Most of us think of delegating as a workplace skill, but it can apply personally as well.
    <p>
    We are all very busy these days with our activities and duties.
    <p>
    Trying to fit it all in and get it all accomplished can lead to tension.
    <p>
    For various reasons, many of us have developed the habit of thinking we must do it all ourselves.
    <p>
    Take a look at your situation.
    <p>
    Think about it, really, how important is it that everything must be done perfectly to your standards?
    <p>
    Are you sure there are not other people who can assist you. Are the other people in your life pulling their weight?
    <p>
    Many times we get into habitual ruts that don't need to be as they are.
    <p>
    Look at what has been, with the eye of reducing the pressure on yourself.
    <p>
    <strong>5. Accept other people as one.</strong><br>
    As you think of yourself as different and separate from the rest of mankind, you unknowingly create thinking and behavior that separates you from others.
    <p>
    This kind of separate thinking leads us to think we are superior to others which leads to judgment then selfish thinking and behavior.
    <p>
    We are then having an internal battle with others, which brings on fear, competition and comparison, ending in frustration and anxiety.
    <p>
    Look to discovering how to see yourself as one with all of mankind, not as separate.
    <p>
    Focus on what we have in common rather that the relatively small uniqueness.
