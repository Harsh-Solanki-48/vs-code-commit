<h1>The Marketing Rollercoaster</h1>
<div style='font-style: italic'>By: Mark McCormack</div><p>
Ever hear someone say "Don't listen to them! They just want to take you on a rollercoaster ride!"
<p>
Many people who care about you and your well being will say something to this effect when you are provided with a business opportunity online. It is a way to deter you from joining up but what does it mean?
<p>
A rollercoaster provides anxiety building climbs, adrenaline pumping falls and exhilarating twists and turns. Half the time one is unsure which direction they are going and after all the ups and downs and twists and turns they find themselves back where they started.
<p>
Like a rollercoaster there are times when business is slow and times when things seem to be overwhelming fast. However, the scariest part is that no one wants to end up where they started with their business. Starting up a business costs money too, so if you end up where you started you are actually at a loss.
<p>
This is what upsets people. No one wants to put themselves through such a stressful event and come out with less than what they put in! It is true that the aim of a rollercoaster is to provide some exciting entertainment, but a business is viewed as a very serious money making system. If you don't make money then the business experience is considered a total waste. A scam.
<p>
But it is exactly this mentality that prevents people from succeeding in life. Money cannot buy happiness. If you're only goal is to make money then every drop, climb and twist in your business will be felt doubly. It will consume you. To a person with this state of mind every missed chance at a sale is a disheartening loss and reason to give up.
<p>
It's like wishing a rollercoaster ride was over as you climb into the seat. Your goal is to have fun but if you are too fearful of the ups and downs then when you get to the end you've missed the point of taking the rollercoaster! Many people get off at the end and say "I'll never do that again!"
<p>
The same can be said for a home business. If you wish you had all the money before you even started your business then you are missing the point of having money. Why did you want to join a business? Most people say for the money but then why would you want money? Many people who start up their businesses do not need it to survive but rather to gain luxuries in their lives. Sure you could buy that new car or house but why does that make you happy?
<p>
It is for the status. It is for the experience; for a sense of freedom and accomplishment. Money does not buy all of these things for you but rather it is the time and energy you have spent taking on the rollercoaster.<br>If you start up a business with the sole intent to make money then you will end up like the other 95% of internet based businesses that fail. The most successful people take heed of the advice, "Watch out, they want to take you on a rollercoaster ride." and expect that there will be ups and downs but they have fun with them. Even if they do not make money they learn from their experiences and apply the knowledge they learn. In real life there are ups and downs to everything and it is the way one deals with these ups and downs that determines the quality of their lives.
<p>
Money is only a symbol of one's real goals. It is an illusion born from materialism that blinds so many people from the rollercoaster ride that is their life; from the rollercoaster that is their business. It makes every twist and every turn more frightening and overwhelming. Do not become blind and miss the ride because sometimes the journey is more important than its end.
