    Have a healthy snack in your lunch time, low fat yogurt for example, to keep your energy running.
    <p>
    <strong>3. Have your dinner three hours before your bedtime.</strong><br>
    Have a Proper dinner three hours before your bedtime; never go to bed on a full stomach.
    <p>
    Drink at least 2 liters of water a day.   2 liters of water a day would help your body to burn calories more effectively and to get rid of toxins.
    <p>
